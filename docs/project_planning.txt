# Project Planning

## Problem Statement  
In academic, corporate, and legal environments, there is a need for efficient comprenhension and decision-making from lengthy documents and articles. However, the time and effort these tasks demand pose a significant challenge. To address this, the SummarAIze model sets out to generate concise summaries while enriching them with contextually relavant details such as background information, definitions, and explantions. 


## Project Scope and Objectives  

* **Model Development**: Develop a summarization model capable of generating concise summaries from lengthy documents.  
* **Contextual Enrichment**: Implement method to enrich the summaries with contextually relevant information to enhance comprehension.  
* **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the model's performance to ensure efficient processing of large volumes of text while maintaining accuracy and coherence in the summaries.  
* **User Interface**: Ensure easy, user-friendly input of documents/articles and retrieval of enriched summaries.  
* **Evaluation**: Conduct thorough evaluation and validation of the model's effectiveness in generating accurate summaries and providing valuable contextual information.  
* **Deployment**: Deploy the model for demo usage.

## Key Deliverables
* Data dictionary and data sources  
* EDA notebooks  
* Model development scripts  
* API code and documentation  
* Presentation materials and project report
