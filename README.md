# SummarAIze
SummarAIze is a model that generates concise summmaries of long documents or articles. These summaries are enhanced with contextually relevant information generated by the AI (e.g. background information, definitions, explanations). Applications of this model could include academic, corporate, or legal environments where detailed summaries aid decision making or learning.
